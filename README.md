# NPM Clone Project


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), aiming to clone the npmjs website functionality and design.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the user interface
- **Redux**: State management library
- **Shadcn**: UI component library for enhanced visual effects
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## 🌟 Key Features

- Replication of npmjs website functionality
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- State management using Redux
- Enhanced UI components with Shadcn

## 📌 Important Notes

- Some information is missing in the API, which may result in incomplete details in certain areas of the application.
